 Ch. 22 Exercise P22.7
 
 Airplane Seating. Write a program that assigns seats on an airplane. assume the airplane has 20 seast in first class (5 rows of 4 seats each, separated by an aisle) and 180 seats in economy class(30 rows of 6 seats each, separated by an aisle). Your program should take three commands: add pasengers, show seating, and quit. When passengers are added, ask for the class (first or economy), the number of passengers travelling together (1 or 2 in first class; 1 to 3 in economy), and the seating preference (aisle or window in first class; aisle, center, or window in economy). Then try to find a match and assign the seats. If no match exists, print a message. Your user interface can be text-based or graphical. Follow the design process that was described in the chapter.
